/*
  âœ… Problem Statement: 

  You are given an array of k linked-lists lists, each linked-list is sorted in ascending order.

  Merge all the linked-lists into one sorted linked-list and return it.

  Example 1:
  Input: lists = [[1,4,5],[1,3,4],[2,6]]
  Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6]
  Explanation: The linked-lists are:
  [
    1->4->5,
    1->3->4,
    2->6
  ]
  merging them into one sorted list:
  1->1->2->3->4->4->5->6

  Example 2:
  Input: lists = []
  Output: []

  Example 2:
  Input: lists = [[]]
  Output: []

// # Brute-force Solution

/*
  # Step-by-step approach:

  1. `mergeTwoSortedLinkedLists` Function:
     - This function takes two sorted linked lists (`list1` and `list2`) and merges them into a single sorted linked list.
     - We use a dummy node to simplify the merging process. The `current` pointer is used to build the new merged list.
     - We iterate through both lists, comparing the current nodes of `list1` and `list2`. The smaller node is appended to the merged list, and we move the pointer of the list from which the node was taken.
     - After the loop, if there are remaining nodes in either `list1` or `list2`, we append them to the merged list.
     - Finally, we return the merged list starting from `dummy.next`.

  2. `mergeKListsSolution1` Function:
     - This function takes an array of k sorted linked lists (`lists`) and merges them into a single sorted linked list.
     - If the input array is empty, we return `null`.
     - If the input array contains only one list, we return that list.
     - We initialize `mergedListHead` with the first list in the array.
     - We iterate through the remaining lists in the array, merging each one with `mergedListHead` using the `mergeTwoSortedLinkedLists` function.
     - After processing all lists, `mergedListHead` will point to the fully merged sorted linked list.
     - We return `mergedListHead` as the result.

  This approach ensures that we merge the k sorted linked lists efficiently by leveraging the helper function to merge two lists at a time.

// # Optimal Solution

/*
  The `mergeKListsSolution2` function merges k sorted linked lists into one sorted linked list.

  # Step-by-step approach:

  1. Priority Queue Initialization:
     - We initialize a `MinPriorityQueue` with a priority function that uses the `val` property of the nodes.
     - This ensures that the node with the smallest value is always at the front of the queue.

  2. Enqueue Initial Nodes:
     - Iterate through each linked list's head node in the `lists` array.
     - If the head node is not null, enqueue it into the priority queue.

  3. Merge Process:
     - Create a dummy node to serve as the starting point of the merged linked list.
     - Maintain a `current` pointer to build the new list.

  4. Dequeue and Enqueue:
     - While the priority queue is not empty:
       - Dequeue the node with the smallest value.
       - Append the dequeued node to the merged list by setting `current.next` to this node.
       - Move the `current` pointer to the newly added node.
       - If this node has a next node, enqueue the next node into the priority queue.

  5. Return the Merged List:
     - The merged linked list starts from `dummy.next` (since `dummy` is a placeholder).

  This approach ensures that we always add the smallest available node to the merged list, maintaining the sorted order.

// # Time Complexity: O(N * (k(k+1)/2)) ~= O(N * (k^2))
// Every time two lists are merged the time complexity is proportional to the sum of the number of nodes in them as we iterate over all nodes and merge according to the data values in them.

// Assume the length of each list to be N1, N2, N3 and so on.
// - In the first iteration, when merging the first two lists (N1 and N2), the time complexity is N1 + N2.
// - In the second iteration, when merging the result of the first iteration with the third list (N3), the time complexity becomes (N1 + N2) + N3.
// - In the third iteration, merging the result of the second iteration with the fourth list (N4), the time complexity becomes ((N1 + N2) + N3) + N4.
// - This pattern continues until all K lists are merged.
// - The total time complexity can be expressed as:

// T = (N1 + N2) + (N1 + N2 + N3) + .... + (N1 + N2 + N3 + .... + Nk)

// For simplification let's assume the length of each linked list to be proportional to N,

// T = N + 2N + 3N + 4N + 5N + .... + kN

// T = N (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + ... + k)

// The sum of lengths of the lists can be calculated using the formula for the sum of the first N natural numbers:
// T = N (k(k+1))/2

// Hence, the time complexity is O(N * (k(k+1)/2)) ~ O(N*(k^2)))

// # Space Complexity: O(1)
// As no additional data structures or space is allocated for storing data, only a constant space for pointers to maintain for traversing the linked list and merging them in place.

// # Time Complexity: O(N * K * log K).
// - Initializing the priority queue takes O(1).
// - Enqueuing the head of each list into the priority queue takes O(k log k), where k is the number of linked lists.
//   This is because each insertion into the priority queue takes O(log k) time, and we do this for each of the k lists.
// - The while loop runs until the priority queue is empty. In the worst case, we process all nodes from all lists.
//   If there are a total of N nodes across all lists, the while loop will run N times.
//   Each dequeue operation takes O(log k) time, and each enqueue operation (for the next node) also takes O(log k) time.
//   Therefore, the total time complexity for the while loop is O(N * K * log K).

// # Space Complexity: O(k), where K is the number of linked lists.
// - The priority queue can hold at most k nodes at any time, so the space complexity for the priority queue is O(k).
// - The dummy node and the merged list use O(1) additional space.
// - Therefore, the overall space complexity is O(k).
