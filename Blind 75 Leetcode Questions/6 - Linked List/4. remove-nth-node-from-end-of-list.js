/*
  âœ… Problem Statement: 

  Given the head of a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of the list and return its head.

  Example 1:
  Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2
  Output: [1,2,3,5]

  Example 2:
  Input: head = [1], n = 1
  Output: []

*/

// # Brute-force Solution

/*
  # Step-by-step approach:
  
  1. Edge Case Handling:
     - If the list is empty (`head` is null) or has only one node (`head.next` is null), return null.
  
  2. Calculate the Length of the List:
     - Initialize `currentNode` to `head`.
     - Traverse the list to count the total number of nodes (`listLength`).
  
  3. Check if the Node to Remove is the Head:
     - If `listLength` is equal to `n`, it means the node to remove is the head of the list.
     - Return `head.next` to remove the head node.
  
  4. Calculate the Position of the Node to Delete:
     - Compute the index of the node to delete (`targetIndex`) as `listLength - n`.
  
  5. Traverse to the Node Before the Target Node:
     - Reset `currentNode` to `head`.
     - Traverse the list until `targetIndex` is 1, which means `currentNode` is the node just before the target node.
  
  6. Remove the Target Node:
     - Set `currentNode.next` to `currentNode.next.next` to bypass the target node.
  
  7. Return the Modified List:
     - Return the modified `head` of the list.

// # Optimal Solution

/*
  This function removes the nth node from the end of a linked list.
  The approach used here is the two-pointer technique, which involves a slow and a fast pointer.

  # Step-by-step approach:

  1. Check if the list is empty or has only one node. If so, return null as there is nothing to remove.
  2. Initialize two pointers, `slow` and `fast`, both pointing to the head of the list.
  3. Move the `fast` pointer `n` steps ahead in the list.
  4. If `fast` becomes null after moving `n` steps, it means we need to remove the head node. Return `head.next` as the new head.
  5. Traverse the list with both `slow` and `fast` pointers until `fast` reaches the end of the list.
  6. At this point, `slow` will be pointing to the node just before the node to be removed.
  7. Adjust the `next` pointer of the `slow` node to skip the node to be removed.
  8. Return the head of the modified list.
