/*
  âœ… Problem Statement: 

  Given head, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.
  There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer. Internally, pos is used to denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer is connected to. 
  !Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.
  Return true if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return false.

  Example 1:
  Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
  Output: true
  Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).
  
  Example 2:
  Input: head = [1], pos = -1
  Output: false
  Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
  
  Example 3:
  Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
  Output: true
  Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 0th node.

// # Brute-force Solution

/*
  # Step-by-step approach:

  1. Initialize a `Set` to keep track of visited nodes. This `Set` will help us
     determine if we have encountered a node more than once.

  2. Start traversing the linked list from the `head` node.

  3. For each node, check if it already exists in the `Set`:
     - If it does, this means we have encountered a cycle, so return `true`.
     - If it does not, add the current node to the `Set` and move to the next node.

  4. Continue this process until we either find a cycle or reach the end of the list.

  5. If we reach the end of the list (i.e., `currentNode` becomes `null`), it means
     there is no cycle in the linked list, so return `false`.

  This approach uses a `Set` to store references to the nodes we have visited.

const hasCycleSolution1 = (head) => {
  // Initialize a Set to keep track of visited nodes
  const visitedNodes = new Set();

  // Start with the head node
  let currentNode = head;

  // Traverse the linked list
  while (currentNode) {
    // If the current node has already been visited, a cycle is detected
    if (visitedNodes.has(currentNode)) {
      return true;
    } else {
      // Otherwise, add the current node to the Set of visited nodes
      visitedNodes.add(currentNode);
      // Move to the next node in the list
      currentNode = currentNode.next;
    }
  }

  // If the end of the list is reached without detecting a cycle, return false
  return false;
};

// # Optimal Solution

/*
  # Step-by-step approach:

  1. Initial Check:
     - If the `head` is null or if there is only one node (`head.next` is null), 
       return `false` immediately as a cycle is not possible in these cases.

  2. Two-Pointer Technique:
     - Use two pointers, `slow` and `fast`, both initialized to the `head` of the linked list.
     - `slow` pointer moves one step at a time (`slow = slow.next`).
     - `fast` pointer moves two steps at a time (`fast = fast.next.next`).

  3. Cycle Detection:
     - Traverse the linked list using the two pointers.
     - In each iteration, check if `fast` can move two steps ahead (`fast.next` and `fast.next.next` are not null).
     - Move `slow` one step and `fast` two steps.
     - If at any point `slow` and `fast` pointers meet, it indicates that there is a cycle in the linked list, 
       so return `true`.

  4. No Cycle:
     - If the loop terminates without the `slow` and `fast` pointers meeting, it means the `fast` pointer 
       has reached the end of the list, and there is no cycle. Hence, return `false`.
