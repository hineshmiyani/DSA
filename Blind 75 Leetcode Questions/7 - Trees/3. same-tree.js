/*
  âœ… Problem Statement: 

  Given the roots of two binary trees `p` and `q`, write a function to check if they are the same or not.
  Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.

  Example 1:
  Input: p = [1,2,3], q = [1,2,3]
  Output: true

  Example 2:
  Input: p = [1,2], q = [1,null,2]
  Output: false

*/

// # Optimal Solution - 1

/*
  # Step-by-step approach:

  This function checks if two binary trees are the same.
  The approach used here is Breadth-First Search (BFS) using two queues.

  1. Initialize two queues, `queue1` and `queue2`, and push the root nodes of both trees into them.

  2. Enter a loop that continues as long as both queues are not empty.

  3. Dequeue the front nodes from both queues and compare them:
     - If both nodes are `null`, continue to the next iteration.
     - If one node is `null` and the other is not, return `false` as the trees are not the same.
     - If the values of the nodes are different, return `false`.

  4. If the nodes are the same, enqueue their left and right children to their respective queues.

  5. After the loop, check if both queues are empty. If they are, return `true` indicating the trees are the same. If not, return `false`.

  This approach ensures that both trees are traversed level by level and compared node by node.

/*
  # Step-by-step approach:

  This approach uses Depth-First Search (DFS) to traverse both trees simultaneously and compare their structure and values.

  1. Base Case: If both trees `p` and `q` are null, they are considered the same, so return true.

  2. If one of the trees is null and the other is not, they are not the same, so return false.

  3. If both trees are non-null, compare their root values:
     - If the root values are equal, recursively check the left subtrees and the right subtrees.
     - If the root values are not equal, return false.

  4. The function returns true only if the root values are equal and both the left and right subtrees are the same.
