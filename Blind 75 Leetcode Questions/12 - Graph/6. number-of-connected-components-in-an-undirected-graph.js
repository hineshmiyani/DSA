/*
  âœ… Problem Statement: 

  There is an undirected graph with n nodes. There is also an edges array, where edges[i] = [a, b] means that there is an edge between node a and node b in the graph.

  The nodes are numbered from 0 to n - 1.

  Return the total number of connected components in that graph.

  Example 1:
  Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1], [0,2]]
  Output: 1

  Example 2:
  Input: n = 6, edges = [[0,1], [1,2], [2,3], [4,5]]
  Output:2

// # Brute-force Solution

/*

  # Step-by-step approach:

  The function `countComponentsSolution1` aims to count the number of connected components in an undirected graph.
  The graph is represented by `n` nodes and a list of edges.
 
  Approach:
  1. Edge Case Handling: If there are no edges, each node is its own component, so return `n`.
 
  2. Graph Construction:
     - Use the `buildGraph` function to convert the list of edges into an adjacency list representation of the graph.
     - The adjacency list is a dictionary where each key is a node, and the value is a list of its neighbors.
 
  3. Component Counting:
     - Initialize a `visited` set to keep track of visited nodes.
     - Initialize a `count` variable to zero to count the number of connected components.
     - Iterate over each node in the graph. For each node, perform a Depth-First Search (DFS) using the `dfs` function.
     - If the DFS returns `true`, it means a new component has been found, so increment the `count`.
 
  4. Depth-First Search (DFS) Function:
     - The `dfs` function takes the current node, the graph, and the visited set as arguments.
     - If the current node has already been visited, return `false`.
     - Mark the current node as visited.
     - Recursively visit all the neighbors of the current node.
     - Return `true` to indicate that a new component has been found.
 
  5. Return the Result:
     - After iterating through all nodes, return the `count` which represents the number of connected components in the graph.

// # Optimal Solution

/*

  # Step-by-step approach:

  This function counts the number of connected components in an undirected graph.
  The graph is represented by `n` nodes and a list of edges.
 
  Approach:
  1. Initialization:
     - If there are no edges, each node is its own component, so return `n`.
     - Initialize two arrays: `parent` and `rank`.
       - `parent` keeps track of the parent of each node, initially set to the node itself.
       - `rank` keeps track of the depth of the tree for each node, initially set to 1.
 
  2. Find Function:
     - This function finds the root parent of a node using path compression.
     - If the node is not its own parent, recursively find the root parent and update the parent of the node.
 
  3. Union Function:
     - This function unites two nodes into the same component.
     - It first finds the root parents of both nodes.
     - If the root parents are the same, the nodes are already in the same component, so return 0.
     - Otherwise, unite the components by attaching the tree with the smaller rank to the tree with the larger rank.
     - Update the rank of the new root parent.
     - Return 1 to indicate that a union was performed.
 
  4. Count Components:
     - Initialize `count` to `n` (each node is initially its own component).
     - Iterate over each edge and perform a union operation on the nodes.
     - If a union is performed, decrement the `count` by 1.
 
  5. Return Result:
     - Return the final count of connected components.

/*
  # Time Complexity: O(V + E)
 
  1. Building the graph:
     - The `buildGraph` function iterates over all edges once.
     - For each edge, it performs constant-time operations to add nodes and edges to the graph.
     - Therefore, the time complexity of building the graph is O(E), where E is the number of edges.
 
  2. Depth-First Search (DFS):
     - In the worst case, DFS visits all nodes and edges in the graph.
     - Each node is visited once, and each edge is traversed once.
     - Therefore, the time complexity of DFS is O(V + E), where V is the number of nodes and E is the number of edges.
 
  3. Counting connected components:
     - The main function iterates over all nodes in the graph.
     - For each node, it performs a DFS if the node has not been visited.
     - Therefore, the overall time complexity for counting connected components is O(V + E).
 
  Overall Time Complexity: O(V + E)

/* 
  # Space Complexity: O(V + E)

  1. Graph Representation:
     - The adjacency list representation of the graph requires space proportional to the number of nodes and edges.
     - Therefore, the space complexity for the graph is O(V + E). 

  2. Visited Set:
     - The `visited` set stores all visited nodes.
     - In the worst case, all nodes are visited, so the space complexity for the visited set is O(V). 

  3. Call Stack for DFS:
     - The recursive DFS function uses the call stack to keep track of nodes being visited.
     - In the worst case, the depth of the recursion is equal to the number of nodes, so the space complexity for the call stack is O(V). 

  Overall Space Complexity: O(V + E)

/*
  # Time Complexity: O((n + E) log n)

  1. Initialization:
     - Initializing the `parent` and `rank` arrays takes O(n) time.

  2. Union-Find Operations:
     - Each `find` operation can take up to O(log n) time due to path compression.
     - Each `union` operation can take up to O(log n) time due to union by rank and the `find` operations involved.

  3. Processing Edges:
     - For each edge, we perform a `union` operation, which involves two `find` operations. Therefore, processing all edges takes O(E * log n) time, where E is the number of edges.

  4. Counting Unique Roots:
     - Finding the root for each node takes O(n * log n) time in the worst case.

  Combining these, the overall time complexity is: O(n + E log n + n log n) = O((n + E) log n)
*/

/*

  # Space Complexity
  
  1. Union-Find Data Structures:
     - The `parent` and `rank` arrays each take O(n) space.
  
  2. Auxiliary Space:
     - Additional space used for storing the unique roots is O(n).
  
  Combining these, the overall space complexity is: O(n)
