  âœ… Problem Statement: 

  Given a reference of a node in a connected undirected graph.
  Return a deep copy (clone) of the graph.

  Each node in the graph contains a value (int) and a list (List[Node]) of its neighbors.
  class Node {
    public int val;
    public List<Node> neighbors;
  }

  Test case format:

  For simplicity, each node's value is the same as the node's index (1-indexed). For example, the first node with val == 1, the second node with val == 2, and so on. 
  The graph is represented in the test case using an adjacency list.

  An adjacency list is a collection of unordered lists used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node in the graph.

  The given node will always be the first node with val = 1. You must return the copy of the given node as a reference to the cloned graph.
 
  Example 1:
  Input: adjList = [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
  Output: [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
  Explanation: There are 4 nodes in the graph.
  1st node (val = 1)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
  2nd node (val = 2)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).
  3rd node (val = 3)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
  4th node (val = 4)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).

  Example 2:
  Input: adjList = [[]]
  Output: [[]]
  Explanation: Note that the input contains one empty list. The graph consists of only one node with val = 1 and it does not have any neighbors.

// # Optimal Solution

  # Step-by-step approach:
  
  1. Base Case: If the input `node` is null, return null immediately as there is nothing to clone.
  
  2. Initialization:
     - Create a `visitedMap` using the `Map` interface to keep track of all the nodes that have been cloned.
     - Add the initial node to the `visitedMap` with a new `Node` instance that has the same value as the original node.
     - Initialize a `queue` with the input node to perform a Breadth-First Search (BFS).
  
  3. BFS Traversal:
     - While the `queue` is not empty, perform the following steps:
       - Dequeue the first node from the `queue` and assign it to `currentNode`.
       - Iterate over each neighbor of `currentNode` (if `neighbors` is not null or undefined):
         - If the neighbor has not been visited (i.e., not present in `visitedMap`):
           - Enqueue the neighbor to the `queue`.
           - Clone the neighbor by creating a new `Node` instance with the same value and add it to the `visitedMap`.
         - Retrieve the cloned version of `currentNode` from `visitedMap`.
         - Add the cloned neighbor to the `neighbors` list of the cloned `currentNode`.
  
  4. Return the Cloned Graph:
     - After the BFS traversal is complete, return the cloned version of the input node from `visitedMap`.
  
  This approach ensures that each node and its connections are cloned exactly once, maintaining the structure of the original graph.

// # Time Complexity: O(V + E)
// The time complexity of this algorithm is O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices (nodes) and E is the number of edges in the graph.
// - Each node is processed once when it is dequeued.
// - Each edge is processed once when iterating through the neighbors of a node.
// Therefore, the total time complexity is O(V + E).

// # Space Complexity: O(V)
// The space complexity of this algorithm is O(V).
// - The `visitedMap` stores a clone for each node, which requires O(V) space.
// - The `queue` can store up to O(V) nodes in the worst case.
// Therefore, the total space complexity is O(V).
