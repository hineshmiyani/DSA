/*
  âœ… Problem Statement: 

  There is a foreign language which uses the latin alphabet, but the order among letters is not "a", "b", "c" ... "z" as in English.

  You receive a list of non-empty strings words from the dictionary, where the words are sorted lexicographically based on the rules of this new language.

  Derive the order of letters in this language. If the order is invalid, return an empty string. If there are multiple valid order of letters, return any of them.

  A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if either of the following is true:
  - The first letter where they differ is smaller in a than in b.
  - There is no index i such that a[i] != b[i] and a.length < b.length.

  Example 1:
  Input: ["z","o"]
  Output: "zo"
  Explanation:
  From "z" and "o", we know 'z' < 'o', so return "zo".

  Example 2:
  Input: ["hrn","hrf","er","enn","rfnn"]
  Output: "hernf"
  Explanation:
  from "hrn" and "hrf", we know 'n' < 'f'
  from "hrf" and "er", we know 'h' < 'e'
  from "er" and "enn", we know get 'r' < 'n'
  from "enn" and "rfnn" we know 'e'<'r'
  so one possible solution is "hernf"

// # Optimal Solution

/*
  # Step-by-step approach:

  1. Graph Initialization:
     - Create an empty graph `graph` to represent the adjacency list of characters.
     - Create an `indegree` object to keep track of the number of incoming edges for each character.
     - Iterate through each word in the `words` list and each character in the word.
     - Initialize each character in the `graph` with an empty array and set its `indegree` to 0 if it hasn't been initialized yet.

  2. Build the Graph:
     - Iterate through the `words` list in pairs (i.e., `words[i]` and `words[i + 1]`).
     - For each pair of words, compare characters one by one until a mismatch is found or one of the words is exhausted.
     - If a mismatch is found, add a directed edge from the mismatched character in the first word to the mismatched character in the second word in the `graph`.
     - Increment the `indegree` of the character in the second word.
     - If the first word is a prefix of the second word, continue to the next pair.

  3. Topological Sort:
     - Initialize a queue and add all characters with `indegree` of 0 (i.e., no incoming edges).
     - Initialize an empty list `topoSort` to store the topologically sorted characters.
     - While the queue is not empty:
       - Remove a character from the queue and add it to `topoSort`.
       - For each neighbor of the current character in the `graph`, decrement its `indegree`.
       - If a neighbor's `indegree` becomes 0, add it to the queue.

  4. Result:
     - If the length of `topoSort` is equal to the number of unique characters, return the characters joined as a string.
     - If not, return an empty string indicating that a valid order is not possible.
