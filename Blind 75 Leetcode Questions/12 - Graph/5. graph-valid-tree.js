  âœ… Problem Statement: 

  Given n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1 and a list of undirected edges (each edge is a pair of nodes), write a function to check whether these edges make up a valid tree.

  Example 1:
  Input: n = 5
  edges = [[0, 1], [0, 2], [0, 3], [1, 4]]
  Output: true

  Example 2:
  Input: n = 5
  edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3], [1, 3], [1, 4]]
  Output: false

*/

// # Optimal Solution

/*
  # Step-by-step approach:

  1. Graph Representation:
     - We start by representing the given edges as an adjacency list. This is done using the `buildGraph` function.
     - The `buildGraph` function takes the edges and constructs a graph where each node points to its neighbors.

  2. Depth-First Search (DFS):
     - We use DFS to traverse the graph and check for cycles and connectivity.
     - The `dfs` function is used to perform the traversal. It takes the current node, the previous node, a set of visited nodes, and the graph as arguments.
     - If a node is revisited (i.e., it is already in the `visited` set), it indicates a cycle, and we return `false`.
     - Otherwise, we add the node to the `visited` set and continue the traversal for its neighbors.
     - If a neighbor is the previous node (the one we came from), we skip it to avoid trivial cycles.
     - If any recursive DFS call returns `false`, it means a cycle is detected, and we propagate this result up the call stack.

  3. Cycle Detection and Connectivity Check:
     - We start the DFS from node `0` with an initial previous node of `-1` (indicating no previous node).
     - If the DFS returns `false`, it means there is a cycle in the graph, and hence it cannot be a valid tree.
     - After the DFS completes, we check if the number of visited nodes is equal to `n` (the total number of nodes). If not, it means the graph is not fully connected.

  4. Final Decision:
     - If the DFS completes without detecting a cycle and all nodes are visited, we return `true`, indicating the graph is a valid tree.
     - Otherwise, we return `false`.

  This approach ensures that we correctly identify whether the given graph is a valid tree by checking for both cycles and connectivity.

/*
  # Time Complexity: O(V + E)
  - The `validTree` function involves three main operations:
    1. Building the graph using `buildGraph(edges)`.
    2. Performing Depth-First Search (DFS) using `dfs(0, -1, visited, graph)`.
    3. Checking if all nodes are visited.

  1. Building the graph:
     - Iterates over each edge once.
     - For each edge, it performs constant-time operations (adding nodes and edges to the graph).
     - Therefore, the time complexity for building the graph is O(E), where E is the number of edges.

  2. Performing DFS:
     - In the worst case, DFS visits each node and each edge once.
     - Therefore, the time complexity for DFS is O(V + E), where V is the number of nodes and E is the number of edges.

  3. Checking if all nodes are visited:
     - This is a constant-time operation, O(1), since it only involves comparing the size of the visited set to the number of nodes.

  Combining these, the overall time complexity of the `validTree` function is O(V + E).
*/

/* 
  # Space Complexity: O(V + E)
  - The space complexity involves the space required to store the graph, the visited set, and the call stack for DFS.

  1. Storing the graph:
     - The graph is stored as an adjacency list.
     - In the worst case, each node has edges to every other node, resulting in O(V + E) space.

  2. Storing the visited set:
     - The visited set stores each node once.
     - Therefore, the space complexity for the visited set is O(V).

  3. Call stack for DFS:
     - In the worst case, the call stack can grow to the size of the number of nodes, O(V).

  Combining these, the overall space complexity of the `validTree` function is O(V + E).
