/*
  âœ… Problem Statement: 

  Given a string s, return the longest palindromic substring in s.

  Example 1:
  Input: s = "babad"
  Output: "bab"
  Explanation: "aba" is also a valid answer.


  Example 2:
  Input: s = "cbbd"
  Output: "bb"

// # Brute-force Solution

/*
  # Step-by-step approach:

  1. Define a helper function `isPalindrome` to check if a given string is a palindrome.
  2. Initialize `longestPalindromeString` as an empty string to store the longest palindrome found.
  3. Iterate through each character in the input `string` using a nested loop.
  4. For each character, create a substring starting from that character and extending to the end of the `string`.
  5. Check if the substring is a palindrome using the `isPalindrome` function and if its length is greater than the length of the current `longestPalindromeString`.
  6. If both conditions are met, update `longestPalindromeString` with the current substring.
  7. Continue this process for all possible substrings in the input `string`.
  8. Finally, return the `longestPalindromeString` found, which is the longest palindromic substring in the input `string`.

// # Optimal Solution

/*
  # Step-by-step approach:

  1. Define a helper function `expandAroundCenter` that takes a string, left, and right indices as parameters. 
     - This function expands around the center (left and right indices) while the characters at those indices are equal and within the string boundaries.
  2. Define the main function `longestPalindromeSolution2` that takes a string as input.
  3. Check if the input string is empty, return an empty string if true.
  4. Initialize variables `start` and `end` to keep track of the longest palindrome substring indices.
  5. Iterate over each character in the string using a for loop.
  6. For each character, expand around the center by calling `expandAroundCenter` twice:
     - Once assuming the current character as the center for odd-length palindromes.
     - Once assuming the current character and the next character as the center for even-length palindromes.
  7. Calculate the maximum length of the palindrome found at the current center using `Math.max`.
  8. If the current palindrome length is greater than the previous longest palindrome length, update the `start` and `end` indices to the new palindrome substring indices.
  9. Finally, return the longest palindrome substring found in the input string using the `start` and `end` indices.

  This approach efficiently finds the longest palindrome substring by expanding around each character in the string and considering both odd and even-length palindromes.

/*
 # Time Complexity:  O(n^2), where n is the length of the input `string`.
 - The `expandAroundCenter` function has a time complexity of O(n) where n is the length of the input `string`.
   This is because in the worst case, it expands to both ends of the string for each center position.
 - The `longestPalindromeSolution2` function iterates through each character in the `string` and for each character,
   it calls `expandAroundCenter` twice. Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n^2), where n is the length of the input `string`.
 
 # Space Complexity: O(1)
 - The `expandAroundCenter` function has a space complexity of O(1) as it uses a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.
 - The `longestPalindromeSolution2` function uses only a constant amount of extra space for variables like `start`, `end`, `length1`, `length2`, and `maxLength`.
   Hence, the space complexity is O(1) as well.
