/*
  âœ… Problem Statement: 

  Given a string s, return the number of palindromic substrings in it.
  A string is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.
  A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within the string.

  Example 1:
  Input: s = "abc"
  Output: 3
  Explanation: Three palindromic strings: "a", "b", "c".


  Example 2:
  Input: s = "aaa"
  Output: 6
  Explanation: Six palindromic strings: "a", "a", "a", "aa", "aa", "aaa".

// # Brute-force Solution

/*
  # Step-by-step approach:

  1. Define a Helper Function (`isPalindrome`):
     - This function checks if a given string is a palindrome.
     - Initialize two pointers, `left` at the start (0) and `right` at the end (string.length - 1) of the string.
     - Use a loop to move the pointers towards the center:
       - If the characters at `left` and `right` pointers do not match, return `false` (not a palindrome).
       - If they match, move `left` pointer one step to the right and `right` pointer one step to the left.
     - If the loop completes without finding mismatched characters, return `true` (it is a palindrome).
  
  2. Main Function (`countPalindromicSubstringsSolution1`):
     - Initialize a counter `count` to keep track of the number of palindromic substrings.
     - Use a nested loop to generate all possible substrings of the input string:
       - The outer loop runs from the start to the end of the string.
       - The inner loop generates substrings starting from the current position of the outer loop to the end of the string.
     - For each generated substring, use the `isPalindrome` function to check if it is a palindrome:
       - If it is a palindrome, increment the `count` by 1.
     - After all substrings have been checked, return the `count` which represents the total number of palindromic substrings.
  
  This approach ensures that all possible substrings are checked for being palindromic, and the helper function efficiently determines if a substring is a palindrome.

const isPalindrome = function (string) {
  let left = 0; // Initialize left pointer at the start of the string
  let right = string.length - 1; // Initialize right pointer at the end of the string

  // Loop until the pointers meet in the middle
  while (left < right) {
    // If characters at left and right pointers don't match, it's not a palindrome
    if (string[left] !== string[right]) {
      return false; // Return false if mismatch is found
    }

    // Move the pointers towards the center
    left = left + 1; // Increment left pointer

const countPalindromicSubstringsSolution1 = (string) => {

    let substring = ""; // Initialize an empty substring

    // Iterate over each character from the starting point to the end of the string
    for (let j = i; j < string.length; j++) {
      substring = substring + string[j]; // Build the substring character by character

      // Check if the current substring is a palindrome

// # Optimal Solution

/*
  # Step-by-step approach:
  
  1. Define a helper function `expandAroundCenter` that takes a string and two indices (`left` and `right`).
     - Initialize a counter `substringsCount` to 0.
     - Use a `while` loop to expand around the center as long as the characters at `left` and `right` are equal and within bounds.
     - For each valid expansion, increment the `substringsCount`.
     - Decrement `left` and increment `right` to expand further.
     - Return the count of palindromic substrings found during this expansion.
  
  2. Define the main function `countPalindromicSubstringsSolution2` that takes a string as input.
     - Initialize a counter `substringsCount` to 0.
     - Iterate through each character in the string using a `for` loop.
     - For each character, call `expandAroundCenter` twice:
       a. Once with the same index for both `left` and `right` to handle odd-length palindromes.
       b. Once with `right` being the next index to handle even-length palindromes.
     - Add the counts returned by both calls to `substringsCount`.
  
  3. Return the total count of palindromic substrings.
  
  This approach ensures that all possible palindromic substrings are counted by expanding around each character and each pair of characters in the string.

// The countPalindromicSubstringsSolution2 function iterates over each character in the string and calls expandAroundCenter twice for each character. Therefore, the overall time complexity is (O(n^2)), where (n) is the length of the string.

// # Space Complexity: O(1)
// The space complexity for both expandAroundCenter and countPalindromicSubstringsSolution2 is (O(1)) because they use a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.
