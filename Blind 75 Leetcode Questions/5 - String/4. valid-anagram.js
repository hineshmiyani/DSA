/*
  âœ… Problem Statement: 

  Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.
  An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

  Example 1:
  Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
  Output: true

  Example 2:
  Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
  Output: false

*/

// Brute-force solution

/*
  # Step-by-Step Approach:

  1. Split the first string `s` into an array of characters.

  2. Sort the array of characters.

  3. Join the sorted array back into a string.

  4. Repeat steps 1-3 for the second string `t`.

  5. Compare the sorted versions of the strings `sortedS` and `sortedT`.

  6. If `sortedS` is not equal to `sortedT`, return `false` indicating that the strings are not anagrams.

  7. If `sortedS` is equal to `sortedT`, return `true` indicating that the strings are anagrams.

/*
  # Step-by-step approach:
  
  1. Check if the lengths of strings `s` and `t` are equal. If not, return false as they cannot be anagrams.

  2. Create a `Map` to count the occurrences of each character in string `t`.

  3. Iterate over each character in string `t` and populate the `Map` with the character counts.

  4. Iterate over each character in string `s` and check against the `Map`:
    - If the character exists in the `Map` and its count is greater than 0, decrement the count in the `Map`.
    - If the character does not exist in the `Map` or its count is 0, return false as `s` and `t` are not anagrams.

  5. If all characters in `s` have been successfully matched with characters in `t`, return true indicating that `s` and `t` are anagrams.

// # Time Complexity: O(n*log n), where (n) is the length of the strings s and t

// # Space Complexity: O(n)
// This is due to the space required to store the arrays created by the split method and the sorted arrays. Each string s and t is split into an array of characters, which requires (O(n)) space, and the sorted arrays also require (O(n)) space.

// # Time Complexity:  O(n), where n is the length of the strings s and t.
// This is because:
// 1. The function first checks if the lengths of s and t are equal, which is an O(1) operation.
// 2. It then iterates over the string t to populate the charCountMap, which takes O(n) time.
// 3, Finally, it iterates over the string s to check against the charCountMap, which also takes O(n) time.
// Since these operations are sequential, the overall time complexity is O(n).

// # Space Complexity: O(1) in the best case and O(n) in the worst case.
// This is because:
// The charCountMap can store up to n unique characters in the worst case, where n is the length of the string t.
// The space used by the map depends on the number of unique characters in t, which in the worst case can be proportional to the length of the string.
// Therefore, the space complexity is O(n) in the worst case.

// # Time Complexity: O(n)
// The function first checks if the lengths of the strings s and t are equal, which takes constant time, (O(1)).
// It then initializes an array charCount of size 26, which also takes constant time, (O(1)).
// The function iterates through each character of both strings once, which takes linear time, (O(n)), where (n) is the length of the strings.
// Finally, it checks if all counts in the charCount array are zero, which takes constant time, (O(1)), since the array size is fixed at 26.
// Combining these steps, the overall time complexity is (O(n)).

// # Space Complexity: O(1)
// The function uses a fixed-size array charCount of length 26 to store character counts. This requires constant space, (O(1)).
// No additional space is used that scales with the input size.
// Therefore, the space complexity is (O(1)).
