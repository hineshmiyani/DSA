  âœ… Problem Statement: 

  Reverse bits of a given 32 bits unsigned integer.

  Example 1:
  Input: n = 00000010100101000001111010011100
  Output:    964176192 (00111001011110000010100101000000)
  Explanation: The input binary string 00000010100101000001111010011100 represents the unsigned integer 43261596, so return 964176192 which its binary representation is 00111001011110000010100101000000.

  Example 2:
  Input: n = 11111111111111111111111111111101
  Output:   3221225471 (10111111111111111111111111111111)
  Explanation: The input binary string 11111111111111111111111111111101 represents the unsigned integer 4294967293, so return 3221225471 which its binary representation is 10111111111111111111111111111111.

// Optimal Solution - 1

/* 
Approach:
  1. Initialization: Start with a result variable initialized to 0.
  2. Bit Manipulation: Iterate through each bit of the input number.
    - Extract the least significant bit (rightmost bit) from the input number using bitwise AND with 1.
    - Shift this bit to its reversed position (31 - current bit index).
    - Combine the shifted bit with the result using bitwise OR.
    - Shift the input number to the right by 1 bit to process the next bit in the next iteration.
  3. Return the Result: After processing all 32 bits, the result will contain the reversed bits.

 * Function to reverse the bits of a given 32-bit unsigned integer.

  // Initialize the result to 0, which will store the reversed bits.

// Optimal Solution - 2
/* 
Approach:
  1. Initialization: Start with a result variable initialized to 0.
  2. Bit Manipulation: Iterate through each bit of the input number.
    - Shift the result to the left by 1 bit to make space for the next bit.
    - Extract the least significant bit (rightmost bit) from the input number using bitwise AND with 1.
    - Add this bit to the result.
    - Shift the input number to the right by 1 bit to process the next bit in the next iteration.
  3. Return the Result: After processing all 32 bits, the result will contain the reversed bits.

// Time Complexity: O(1)
// This is because the loop runs a fixed number of times (32 iterations), regardless of the input size. Each operation inside the loop (bitwise operations and shifts) takes constant time.

// Space Complexity: O(1)
// The function uses a constant amount of extra space for the variables result, lastBit, and reverseLastBit, and these do not depend on the size of the input.

// Time Complexity: O(1)
// This is because the function always iterates exactly 32 times, regardless of the input. The number of operations is constant and does not depend on the size of the input.

// Space Complexity: O(1)
// The function uses a fixed amount of extra space for variables (result and lastBit), which does not grow with the size of the input.
