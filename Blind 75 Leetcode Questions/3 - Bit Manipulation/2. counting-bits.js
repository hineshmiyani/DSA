  âœ… Problem Statement: 

  Given an integer n, return an array ans of length n + 1 such that for each i (0 <= i <= n), ans[i] array is the number of 1's in the binary representation of i.

  Example 1:
  Input: n = 2
  Output: [0,1,1]
  Explanation:
  0 --> 0
  1 --> 1
  2 --> 10


  Example 2:
  Input: n = 5
  Output: [0,1,1,2,1,2]
  Explanation:
  0 --> 0
  1 --> 1
  2 --> 10
  3 --> 11
  4 --> 100
  5 --> 101
