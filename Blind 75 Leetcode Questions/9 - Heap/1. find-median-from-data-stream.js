  âœ… Problem Statement: 

  The median is the middle value in an ordered integer list. If the size of the list is even, there is no middle value, and the median is the mean of the two middle values.

  For example, for arr = [2,3,4], the median is 3.
  For example, for arr = [2,3], the median is (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5.
  Implement the MedianFinder class:

  MedianFinder() initializes the MedianFinder object.
  void addNum(int num) adds the integer num from the data stream to the data structure.
  double findMedian() returns the median of all elements so far. Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.

  Example 1:
  Input
  ["MedianFinder", "addNum", "addNum", "findMedian", "addNum", "findMedian"]
  [[], [1], [2], [], [3], []]

  Output
  [null, null, null, 1.5, null, 2.0]

  Explanation
  MedianFinder medianFinder = new MedianFinder();
  medianFinder.addNum(1);    // arr = [1]
  medianFinder.addNum(2);    // arr = [1, 2]
  medianFinder.findMedian(); // return 1.5 (i.e., (1 + 2) / 2)
  medianFinder.addNum(3);    // arr[1, 2, 3]
  medianFinder.findMedian(); // return 2.0

*/

// # Optimal Solution

/*
  # Step-by-step approach:

  1. Initialization:
     - We need to maintain two heaps: a `max-heap` to store the smaller half of the numbers and a `min-heap` to store the larger half.
     - The `MaxPriorityQueue` will be used for the `max-heap` and the `MinPriorityQueue` for the `min-heap`.
     - The max-heap will allow us to quickly access the largest number in the smaller half, and the min-heap will allow us to quickly access the smallest number in the larger half.
     - The `MedianFinder` class will have two properties: `maxHeap` and `minHeap`.

  2. Adding a Number (`addNum` method):
     - When a new number is added using the `addNum` method, we need to decide which heap to add it to.
       - If the number is smaller than or equal to the maximum element of the max-heap (or if the max-heap is empty), it should be added to the max-heap.
       - Otherwise, it should be added to the min-heap.
     - After adding the number, we need to balance the heaps to ensure that the difference in size between the two heaps is at most 1.
       - If the max-heap has more than one extra element compared to the min-heap, move the root of the max-heap to the min-heap.
       - Similarly, if the min-heap has more than one extra element compared to the max-heap, move the root of the min-heap to the max-heap.
  
  3. Finding the Median (`findMedian` method):
     - If both heaps have the same size, the median is the average of the roots of both heaps.
     - If the max-heap has more elements, the median is the root of the max-heap.
     - If the min-heap has more elements, the median is the root of the min-heap.

  4. Example:
     - For the input sequence [1, 2, 3]:
       - Add 1: max-heap = [1], min-heap = []
       - Add 2: max-heap = [1], min-heap = [2]
       - Find median: (1 + 2) / 2 = 1.5
       - Add 3: max-heap = [1], min-heap = [2, 3]
       - Balance heaps: max-heap = [1, 2], min-heap = [3]
       - Find median: 2

  This approach ensures that both the insertion and median finding operations are efficient, with a time complexity of O(log n) for insertion and O(1) for finding the median.

// # Time Complexity:
// - The `addNum` method has a time complexity of O(log n) due to the heap operations (enqueue and dequeue).
