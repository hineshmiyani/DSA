  âœ… Problem Statement: 

  Given an m x n board of characters and a list of strings words, return all words on the board.

  Each word must be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, where adjacent cells are horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once in a word.

  Example 1:
  Input: board = [["o","a","a","n"],["e","t","a","e"],["i","h","k","r"],["i","f","l","v"]], words = ["oath","pea","eat","rain"]
  Output: ["eat","oath"]

  Example 2:
  Input: board = [["a","b"],["c","d"]], words = ["abcb"]
  Output: []

*/

// # Optimal Solution

/*

  # Step-by-step approach:

  The problem at hand is to find all words from a given list that can be formed by sequentially
  adjacent letters on a 2D board. The words can be constructed from letters of sequentially
  adjacent cells, where "adjacent" cells are those horizontally or vertically neighboring.
  The same letter cell may not be used more than once in a word.
 
  To solve this problem, we can use a Trie (Prefix Tree) to efficiently store and search for
  the words. The Trie allows us to quickly check if a prefix of a word exists in the list of
  words, which helps in pruning the search space during the Depth-First Search (DFS) on the board.
 
  1. Trie Construction:
     - Create a Trie data structure and insert all the words from the given list into the Trie.
     - Each node in the Trie represents a character and contains a collection of child nodes.
     - The end of a word is marked by a boolean flag `isEndOfWord` and the complete word is stored
       in the `word` property of the end node.
 
  2. DFS Initialization:
     - Traverse each cell in the 2D board.
     - For each cell, if the character is a child of the root node in the Trie, initiate a DFS
       from that cell.
 
  3. DFS Traversal:
     - The DFS function explores all possible paths from the current cell.
     - Base Cases:
       - It checks boundary conditions and whether the cell has already been visited.
       - If the current character is not a child of the current Trie node, the search is pruned.
     - If a complete word is found (i.e., `isEndOfWord` is true), it is added to the result list
       and marked as found to avoid duplicates.
     - The cell is marked as visited by temporarily changing its value to `#`.
     - The DFS function recursively explores all four possible directions (right, bottom, left, top).
     - After exploring all directions, the cell's original character is restored.
 
  4. Result Compilation:
     - The list of found words is returned as the final result.
 
  This approach ensures that we efficiently search for words in the board by leveraging the
  Trie data structure to prune unnecessary searches and using DFS to explore all possible
  paths in the board.

  # Time Complexity: O(W * L + M * N * 4^L)
  
  1. Trie Construction:
     - Inserting each word into the Trie takes O(L) time, where L is the length of the word.
     - For W words, the total time complexity for Trie construction is O(W * L).
  
  2. DFS Initialization:
     - We traverse each cell in the board, which takes O(M * N) time, where M is the number of rows and N is the number of columns.
  
  3. DFS Traversal:
     - In the worst case, each cell in the board is visited once, and for each cell, we explore up to 4 possible directions.
     - The time complexity for DFS traversal is O(M * N * 4^L), where L is the maximum length of the words.
     - However, due to the Trie pruning, the actual number of explorations is significantly reduced.
  
  Overall Time Complexity:
     - The overall time complexity is O(W * L + M * N * 4^L).
  
  # Space Complexity:  O(W * L + M * N)
  
  1. Trie Construction:
     - The space complexity for storing the Trie is O(W * L), where W is the number of words and L is the average length of the words.
  
  2. DFS Traversal:
     - The space complexity for the DFS recursion stack is O(L), where L is the maximum length of the words.
     - The space complexity for the visited cells is O(M * N).
  
  Overall Space Complexity:
     - The overall space complexity is O(W * L + M * N).
