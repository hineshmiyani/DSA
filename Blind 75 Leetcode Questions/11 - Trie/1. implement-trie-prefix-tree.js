/*
  âœ… Problem Statement: 

  A trie (pronounced as "try") or prefix tree is a tree data structure used to efficiently store and retrieve keys in a dataset of strings. 
  There are various applications of this data   structure, such as autocomplete and spellchecker.

  Implement the Trie class:
  - Trie() Initializes the trie object.
  - void insert(String word) Inserts the string word into the trie.
  - boolean search(String word) Returns true if the string word is in the trie (i.e., was inserted before), and false otherwise.
  - boolean startsWith(String prefix) Returns true if there is a previously inserted string word that has the prefix prefix, and false otherwise.

  Example 1:
  Input:
  ["Trie", "insert", "search", "search", "startsWith", "insert", "search"]
  [[], ["apple"], ["apple"], ["app"], ["app"], ["app"], ["app"]]

  Output:
  [null, null, true, false, true, null, true]

  Explanation:
  Trie trie = new Trie();
  trie.insert("apple");
  trie.search("apple");   // return True
  trie.search("app");     // return False
  trie.startsWith("app"); // return True
  trie.insert("app");
  trie.search("app");     // return True

*/

// # Optimal Solution

/*

  # Step-by-step approach:

  1. `TrieNode` Class:
     - This class represents a single node in the Trie.
     - Each node has two properties:
       - `children`: An object that maps characters to their corresponding child nodes.
       - `isEndOfWord`: A boolean flag indicating whether the node marks the end of a valid word.

  2. `Trie` Class:
     - This class represents the Trie data structure.
     - It has a root node which is an instance of `TrieNode`.

  3. `insert` Method:
     - This method inserts a word into the Trie.
     - Start from the root node and iterate through each character of the word.
     - For each character, check if it exists in the current node's children.
       - If it does not exist, create a new `TrieNode` and add it to the children.
     - Move to the child node corresponding to the current character.
     - After processing all characters, mark the last node as the end of a word by setting `isEndOfWord` to true.

  4. `search` Method:
     - This method searches for a word in the Trie.
     - Start from the root node and iterate through each character of the word.
     - For each character, check if it exists in the current node's children.
       - If it does not exist, return false.
     - Move to the child node corresponding to the current character.
     - After processing all characters, return the value of `isEndOfWord` of the last node to determine if the word exists in the Trie.

  5. `startsWith` Method:
     - This method checks if there is any word in the Trie that starts with the given prefix.
     - Start from the root node and iterate through each character of the prefix.
     - For each character, check if it exists in the current node's children.
       - If it does not exist, return false.
     - Move to the child node corresponding to the current character.
     - After processing all characters, return true as the prefix exists in the Trie.

// # Time Complexity: O(m), the time complexity for each operation is linear with respect to the length of the word or prefix.

// 2. Search: O(m), where m is the length of the word being searched. Each character of the word is processed once.
// 3. StartsWith: O(m), where m is the length of the prefix. Each character of the prefix is processed once.
// Overall, the time complexity for each operation is linear with respect to the length of the word or prefix.

// # Space Complexity:
// 1. Insertion: O(m * n), where m is the length of the longest word and n is the number of words.
//    Each node in the Trie can have up to 26 children (for each letter of the alphabet).
// 2. Search and StartsWith: O(1) additional space, as they do not require extra space proportional to the input size.
// Overall, the space complexity is primarily determined by the number of nodes in the Trie, which depends on the total length of all words inserted.
