/*
  âœ… Problem Statement: 

  Given a sorted array of N integers and an integer x, write a program to find the lower bound of x.

  Example 1:
  Input Format: N = 4, arr[] = {1,2,2,3}, x = 2
  Result: 1
  Explanation: Index 1 is the smallest index such that arr[1] >= x.

  Example 2:
  Input Format: N = 5, arr[] = {3,5,8,15,19}, x = 9
  Result: 3
  Explanation: Index 3 is the smallest index such that arr[3] >= x.

// Brute-force Solution
/**
 * This function finds the lower bound of a target value in a sorted array.
 * The lower bound is the index of the first element in the array that is not less than the target.
 * If all elements in the array are less than the target, it returns the length of the array.
 *
 * @param {number[]} arr - The sorted array in which to find the lower bound.
 * @param {number} target - The target value for which to find the lower bound.
 * @returns {number} - The index of the first element that is not less than the target, or the length of the array if no such element exists.

    if (arr[index] >= target) {
