/*
  âœ… Problem Statement: 

  You are given a sorted array containing N integers and a number X, you have to find the occurrences of X in the given array.

  Example 1:
  Input: N = 7,  X = 3 , array[] = {2, 2 , 3 , 3 , 3 , 3 , 4}
  Output: 4
  Explanation: 3 is occurring 4 times in the given array so it is our answer.

  Example 2:
  Input: N = 8,  X = 2 , array[] = {1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3}
  Output: 5
  Explanation: 2 is occurring 5 times in the given array so it is our answer
