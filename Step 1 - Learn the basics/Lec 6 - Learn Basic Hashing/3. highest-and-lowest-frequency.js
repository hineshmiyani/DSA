/*
  âœ… Problem Statement: 

  Given an array of size N. Find the highest and lowest frequency element.

  Example 1:
  Input: array[] = {10,5,10,15,10,5};
  Output: 10 15
  Explanation: The frequency of 10 is 3, i.e. the highest and the frequency of 15 is 1 i.e. the lowest.

  Example 2:
  Input: array[] = {2,2,3,4,4,2};
  Output: 2 3
  Explanation: The frequency of 2 is 3, i.e. the highest and the frequency of 3 is 1 i.e. the lowest.
